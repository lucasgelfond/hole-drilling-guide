I was recently building a quadcopter, the Hoverthings Flip Sport when I realized that some gear that I wanted to add mounted via mounting holes that I didn't have. Rather than aimlessly drilling holes that were terribly off center and badly measured, a friend reccomended that I 3D Print a guide to make the process easier.

The idea is to print a guide that screws into holes that are ALREADY drilled and confirmed to be centered on the frame, and use those as a reference for where to drill new ones.

And so I designed a parametric piece in OpenSCAD that allows you to essentially input two mounting hole patterns, and spits out a file that has both patterns perfectly aligned with center as well as an "X" to mark direct center.

I just added the files. I have yet to do any printing, but I will update this README when I have.

Enjoy yourself.
